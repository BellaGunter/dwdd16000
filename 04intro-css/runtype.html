        <h2>Different types of running</h2>
        <p>There are many styles of running and we encourage you to participate in more than one, however it might take some experimentation to identify which ones work best for you. But heres a list of the top 5 types of running and a description for each. </p>
        <!--start of my pagecontent-->
        <h1> Top running styles:</h1>
               <span> &bull;<b>Long Distance</b></span>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Distance: Long Distance, also known as Cross Country (XC) running; typically ranges from 5 kilometers (5K) to marathons (42.195 kilometers) and even ultramarathons (usually anything longer than 42.195 kilometers).</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Pace: Generally performed at a sustained, slower pace compared to other forms of running. Typically, you should be able to comfortably maintain conversation while running at this pace.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Focus: Endurance and aerobic capacity are crucial. Runners need to maintain a steady pace for an extended period of time as runs can take as long as 5 hours to complete or more.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Terrain: Long distance races are often conducted on roads, tracks, or trails. It mostly depends on where you live but you should choose the terrain that will keep you the most entertained.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Training: Requires a high volume of mileage and emphasis on building cardiovascular endurance.</li>
                </ol>
                <span>&bull;<b>Mid Distance</b></span>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Distance: Typically includes races ranging from 800 meters (800m) to 1500 meters (1500m), also known as the 800m and 1500m events in most races.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Pace: Runners need to balance speed and endurance, so pacing is critical.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Focus: Requires a combination of aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, it just depends on how far and fast you go.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Terrain: Terrain can vary, it is mainly what you as a runner perfer but for the most part this is performed on paved trails, tracks or roads.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Training: Focuses on speed, pacing, and lactate threshold development. Training may also involve interval workouts. Which we will go into with more depth on the "Training Plan" portion.</li>
                </ol>
                <span>&bull;<b>Short Distance Sprints</b></span>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Distance: Sprinting events are very short, with common distances being 100 meters (100m), 200 meters (200m), and 400 meters (400m).</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Pace: These races are explosive and high-intensity, often performed at maximum effort.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Focus: Primarily relies on the anaerobic energy system and power.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Terrain: Sprinting events are conducted on tracks or specially designed courses, mainly for safety purposes.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Training: Sprinters emphasize strength, explosive power, and technique. Training includes short, high-intensity intervals and weightlifting.</li>
                </ol>
                <span>&bull;<b>Mountain Running</b></span>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Distance: Varies widely but typically remains in the Mid to Long distances and involves running up and down mountainous terrain, including steep ascents and descents.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Pace: Pace can vary greatly depending on the terrain, but it often involves bursts of intense effort followed by slower sections. Many times the speed of particular portions is based on race technique and the course terrain.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Focus: Requires a combination of aerobic endurance and strength, as well as the ability to adapt to varying altitudes and terrain conditions including streams, rivers, boulders, pebles, sand, and mud to name a few.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Terrain: Mountain running is done on rugged and often challenging terrain, including trails, paths, and off-road routes.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Training: Involves building strength, endurance, and agility for steep inclines and declines. Altitude training and calisthenics is also beneficial for mountain running.</li>
                </ol>
                <span>&bull;<b>Trail Running</b></span>
                <ol>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Distance: Covers a wide range of distances but typically remains in the Mid to Long ranges.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Pace: Varied pace due to uneven terrain, including hills, rocks, and roots.</li> 
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Focus: Requires agility, adaptability, and a mix of aerobic and anaerobic effort.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Terrain: Takes place on natural trails, often with technical sections and often on natural, unpaved trails.</li>
                <li style="text-indent: 10px;">Training: Incorporates endurance, strength, agility, calisthenics and navigation skills for varying trail conditions.</li>
                </ol>
